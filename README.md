# A hearing test simulator GUI for clinical testing 

## Overview
This GitHub repository provides for GUI for hearing test simulator on Windows platform using Matlab. The example codes provided here is for hearing improvement studies. 

> **Abstract:** This paper presents an overview of a useful MATLAB based GUI for hearing testing to evaluate the subjects’ hearing ability in noisy environments with different SNR values. With this software package, the examiner will be able to identify which words are correctly perceived and then collect test data in various conditions to measure the performance of the subjects in hearing tests. From the subjects’ responses, word recognition rates are saved by the examiner with different noise types such as babble, traffic, machinery, and white noise. Additionally, the subjective tests are completed through repeated testing circles. All hearing testing data and word recognition rate are saved into the database for later use purpose and analysis. This computer aided simulation makes a reliable and cost effective to create real environmental conditions for clinical testing. Our MATLAB based GUI addresses the needs of both clinical evaluation and engineering.
